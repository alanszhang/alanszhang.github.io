      There's not much on here right now, but come back soon and you might catch something new!
      I'm a UC Berkeley student and you can find my resume <a href = "resume.pdf">here.</a>
      I also like to <a href = "https://pioneers.berkeley.edu">build robots for kids</a>, so check that out too!
